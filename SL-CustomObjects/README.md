# SL-CustomObjects
 The project that allows you to create schematics out of in-game items in SCP: Secret Labortatory.
 
 ## Requirements
 - Unity Editor (the project is made in `Unity version 2020.3.0f1` but probably the version won't matter too much.
 - A couple of GBs of free space (probably 5 GB). The reason behind it is, when you first launch the project Unity needs to create the **Library** folder for faster loading times etc.
 - 
 Clone that repository and then open that cloned repo via unity editor

Put `.json` file into `EXILED/Configs/MapEditorReborn/Schematics` folder.

After that, you can use `mp create schematicName` to spawn the schematic.
