# SL-CustomObjects
 The project that allows you to create schematics out of in-game items in SCP: Secret Labortatory.
 
 ## Requirements
 - Unity Editor (the project is made in `Unity version 2020.3.0f1` but probably the version won't matter too much.
 - A couple of GBs of free space (probably 5 GB). The reason behind it is, when you first launch the project Unity needs to create the **Library** folder for faster loading times etc.

## Setting it up
- Step 1
 [**Download the MapEditorReborn source code**](https://github.com/Michal78900/MapEditorReborn/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
 
 - Step 2
 Unzip the file and keep only the **SL-CustomObjects** folder. You can remove the rest.

- Step 5
Put `.json` file into `EXILED/Configs/MapEditorReborn/Schematics` folder.
After that, you can use `mp create schematicName` to spawn the schematic.
